- actions.json file has an invalid trailing ',' on the codeword=5001 element, which cannot be
parsed, so has been removed in the copy of the file used here

- actions.json codeword and id elements appear to be reversed, id should probably be the numeric unique value,
and codeword should probably be the string value. This implementation has left the example file as is, apart from
the removal of the invalid trailing ','
